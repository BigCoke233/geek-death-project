Let's be totally honest. **IntelliJ IDEA is bloated, slow and buggy.** It's not the worst tool but certainly does not provide a comfortable dev experience (tho their web page says "Built for your comfort"), especially when it's so damn expensive!

The one thing I don't understand is how people urge Java beginners to download this software filled with magic buttons when they don't understand how everything works. For me, I never fully understand the underlying mechanism of "Run/Debug" button —— It does too many things! It runs a single Java file with a main function but also build a WAR package, start a local server and runs your application. When I started out learning Java and Spring, people just told me to configure this and configure that, simply asking me to follow a set of instructions that seems to come out of nowhere. And then, I was told to hit the "Run" button. And boom. There's your project up and running. Start Developing!

Softwares like IDEA make development unnecessarily complicated with too many user interfaces. I can put up with photo and video editing app like PhotoShop being complex in user interface, for there's no other way to do it. But for software development? Why would I need all those sections and subsections in the setting panel when a bunch of text files can do the work just fine?

When the interface is like this, learning Java Development becomes two things: The basic language knowledge (the syntax, common libraries and best practices) and HOW TO GET THIS GODDAMN THING TO F\*CKING WORK. 

I don't see C programmers losing their minds because their editors break. In fact, let's appreciate the beauty of C development. You got a simple editor, a trusty compiler, and... nothing else. Your compiler tells you what went wrong, and you fix it. That's it! Though every JavaScript developer hates JavaScript, it also requires only an editor and NPM to work, as simple as C. There might be tools like ESLint and husky that adds to the workflow, but they're introduced by our choice. We know what we're doing and we know why we need them.

Integrated development environment is a sin
