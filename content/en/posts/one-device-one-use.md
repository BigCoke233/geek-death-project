I remember struggling with all kinds of syncing methods when I started out using Obsidian and Logseq, which are both great apps but require third-party data syncing if you do not have a subscription.

Why do I need to sync data across from all my devices? Well, I obviously need them on my laptop, tablet computer and smartphone... Right...?

Cruelly, the answer is no. It's nice to have all the information you need on all of your devices, but it's hardly the case where you'll actually be taking or reading notes on your smartphone and you'll probably never open Duolingo on your laptop. 

I used to tell myself I'll sync my notes on my iPhone just for browsing. The truth is that never happened. Logseq on iOS, for me, is just an icon that shouts "Hey, I'm a smart guy who use fancy note-taking apps!".

This leads to the topic of today's post: You don't need omnipotent device that does everything but multiple powerful tools that does one or two things just the way they should be done.

## What is *One Item, One Use*?

I read this concept in a book, whose name I don't really remember. It's quite popular in the context of productivity and household management. It simply means using one item just for one purpose.

For instance, if your couch is just for sitting on when watching television, then you shouldn't be napping or eating on it. Otherwise, you'll get sleepy or craving for food even when you just wanted to sit down and enjoy a good show.

The same goes for devices. If you use your smartphone for browsing social media, being in touch with your friends and, of course, answering calls, then you shouldn't be reading or taking notes on it as well. It's very likely to get distracted when trying to focus on something.

## Why *One Device, One Use*?

Using one thing for just one purpose can help with mental declutter, being in the present, better focus, clear goals, quicker decision-making... I know I just listed a litany of cliché concepts from self-help books, so just let me explain.

I own three devices (MacBook, iPad, iPhone), four if you count my smart watch. I am given various tasks every day, by my professors, my boss and myself. Question: which device should I use respectively for taking notes on class, brainstorming a new project idea, updating a worksheet, and reading an article.

This is a decision-making issue. With the right app installed, I can complete any of these tasks on any of my devices. ==Being given a lot of options is not always pleasant.== 

If you can only complete a certain task on a certain device, you'll know exactly what to do and how to do it. For example, before heading out for a meeting, I might think twice on whether to take note with my keyboard or do that with a pen and paper. However, if I have some rules, which forbids me to take meeting notes with any other methods but an iPad, I can make that decision in an instant.

I have email app and IM apps installed on all of my devices. Sometimes I get confused about what to do. I might get back from a lunch break and started answering messages on my laptop, when I should be dealing with an important email.

This is a focus issue. If you don't see push notifications popping out on your laptop screen but only red dots on your email app, you won't be having this problem.

If you have more than one device like I do, consider practicing this *One Device, One Use* principle with me.

## Form follows function

Though we are not product designers, but we do need functions provided by devices that comes with a certain form.

If you are not a millionaire, the reason you buy a laptop is mostly likely that you needed it for school or work.
