## Note is a four-letter word

I used to be obsessed with taking pretty notes. Here's my old Obsidian vault and I haven't opened it for almost a year.

The link graph is pretty, the whiteboard seems brilliant, and god, I even color-coded all my folders? And they got icons? They're so pretty that I don't even want to click on it. 

And I surely did not. These well-organized brilliant-looking notes never actually helped me learn anything. Well, maybe a little, but all the good learning happened while I'm doing actual work, not taking pretty notes.

In school, teachers evaluate students' academic performance merely by looking at their notes. I remember in my middle school and high school, if a kid's book is almost illegible due to the fact that they have written useless words all over the page, they are considered as a diligent child. And guess what, we all try to write as much crap as possible but never even think to review it.

It almost seems that the more pretty notes you've taken, the less you learn. 

However, taking notes is not always like this.
