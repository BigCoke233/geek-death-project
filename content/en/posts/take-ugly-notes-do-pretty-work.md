## Note is a four-letter word

I used to be obsessed with taking pretty notes. Here's my old Obsidian vault and I haven't opened it for almost a year.

The link graph is pretty, the whiteboard seems brilliant, and god, I even color-coded all my folders? And they got icons? They're so pretty that I don't even want to click on it. 

And I surely did not. 

These well-organized brilliant-looking notes never actually helped me learn anything. Well, maybe a little, but all the good learning happened while I'm doing actual work, not taking pretty notes.

In school, if not taking tests, teachers evaluate students' academic performance merely by looking at their notes. I remember in my middle school and high school, if a kid's book is almost illegible because they have written useless words all over the page, they are considered as a diligent child. And guess what, we all try to write as much crap as possible but never even think to review it.

However, taking notes is not always like this. I believe written languages are born because humans desire to remember things and master skills. We invented speaking to communicate and writing to take notes. When goals are clear, we know what to write and what not to write. Nobody has ever struggled to find the perfect note-taking method.

I think we all need to stop for a second to think about why we take notes.
